# So U Found A Mutation? (SUFAM)

Found a mutation in one or more samples? Now you want to check if they are in
another sample. Unfortunately mutect, varscan or whatever other variant caller
is not calling them. Use SUFAM. The super sensitive validation caller that
calls everything on a given position. All you need is a vcf with the mutations
that you are interested in and the sam/bam file of the sample where you want to
find the same inconsipicuous mutation.

## Installation
